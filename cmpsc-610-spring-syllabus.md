## Introduction

Your senior thesis process affords you the opportunity to pursue independent
research in computer and information science. This course parallels the kinds of intense inquiry
and research inherent to both academic life and a career as a computer
scientist, data scientist, information technologist or software engineer. To that end, you will work
closely with your readers to explore rich, ever-complex, projects. Though the
faculty cannot promise that this work will be frustration- or challenge-free, we
invite you to pursue it with great enthusiasm, vigor, and to -- above all --
find joy in the process.

## Course Description

- Students who are registered for `DOUBL 610` are responsible for ensuring that
  the non-CMPSC first reader for their senior comprehensive project is able to
  attend on the assigned date for their presentation or that an alternative date
  is scheduled for their presentation.
- A senior thesis defense includes the following components with the stated
  time limits
    - Senior thesis presentation: 10 minutes
    - Question and answer session: 5 minutes
    - Demonstration of computation artifact: 1 minute
- Presenting students must strictly adhere to the stated time limits.
- The readers for a senior comprehensive project may submit additional
  questions to the GitHub issue tracker in the repository for a
  student's senior thesis. Students will have twenty-four hours to response to
  all of the questions that the readers shared in the issue tracker.
- All students are required to attend and participate as audience members in all
  of the senior thesis defenses.
- Since senior thesis defenses will take place in both Alden 101 and Alden 109,
  approximately half of the students should attend defenses in one room and half
  should do the same in the other room.

## Assessment Strategy

To pass `CMPSC 610`, submission of and participation in all of the primary
requirements is mandatory.
In addition to an overall evaluation of each category, a student's work in
`CMPSC 610` will be evaluated according to each of the following baseline
requirements.
Students who are enrolled in `DOUBL 610` are also required to write a course
contract that describes the deliverables and the deadlines by which they will
complete them for both `CMPSC 610` and the course for their additional major.
Importantly, students in `DOUBL 610` must complete _all_ of the requirements for
_both_ `CMPSC 610` _and_ the `610` course connected to their other major.
Students who enroll in `DOUBL 610` should submit their course contract to both
of their first readers and the `CMPSC 610` course coordinator.

proposal directly to the IRB and may not start working on any of their experiments
before receiving IRB approval.

## Required Materials

### Course Textbooks

There are no required textbooks for this course.
However, the faculty _highly recommend_ investing in the following texts for
both academic and professional development:

### Course Platforms

* [ReadyResearchers Organization on GitHub](https://github.com/ReadyResearchers)
* [Ready, Set, Research! Discord Server](https://discord.gg/KBMAHZRH9x)

This course relies heavily on the above GitHub organization and Discord server.
Your work will be assigned and evaluated on and crucial communication
distributed through these two platforms.
You are expected to register for and remain active on these platforms throughout
the academic year.

### Course Repositories

You are responsible for accepting and maintaining GitHub repositories for each
of the assigned course projects.
Repositories include completion- and submission-specific instructions via
`README` files.
Many of these operations feature using GitHub's tagging mechanism to release
PDFs of your proposal with versions that adhere to the course's semantic
versioning standard.

**Course instructors will only grade and provide feedback on projects that are
stored in and properly released through GitHub.**

## Course Policies

### Course Attendance

It is mandatory for all students to attend the course sessions.
If, due to extenuating circumstances, you will not be able to attend a session,
then, whenever possible, please communicate with the course coordinator at least
one week in advance to describe your situation.
Students who have any signs of illness should not attend any in-person course
sessions.

### Email Policy

Despite the fact that the majority of our communication relies on the [Ready,
Set, Research!
Discord Server](https://discord.gg/KBMAHZRH9x) and other platforms such as the
[ReadyResearchers Organization on GitHub](https://github.com/ReadyResearchers),
the faculty may occasionally use email to communicate significant information.
As with other the other platforms used by this course, it is your responsibility
to be accountable for email communication.

### Syllabus Revision

The faculty of the Department of Computer and Information Science reserve the right to make
changes to this syllabus document.
Should a change occur, they may be discussed with the members of the course
community.
Minor revisions to wording that do not impact course events or deliverables may
be made without notice.
Any change which impacts dates or significant changes in student responsibility
will be communicated -- in writing -- at least one week in advance of the due
date of the deliverable affected.

### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code.
Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment.
Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of
Computer and Information Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course,
and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with
teachers, student assistants, and fellow students.
Such dialogue is encouraged.
However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who
discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who
produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone
else’s work.
It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the
Department of Computer and Information Science are to be the original work of the student
submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the
provisions of the Honor Code.
Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were
derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the
department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the
general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the
_Compass_.

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack
Overflow or text generation systems such as ChatGPT.

### Classroom Ethics

The discipline of computer and information science, like many others, encourages its members to
act according to discipline-specific ethics.
The faculty encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM) [Code of
Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Seeking Assistance

#### Course Assistance

Students who struggle to understand the knowledge and skills introduced in this course
are encouraged to seek assistance from their first and second readers.
To meet with your first and second readers, please visit their web site.
Historically, students who are successful in department courses visit and
discuss course processes and assignments early and often.

#### Outside Assistance

If you find yourself in difficult circumstances which affect your ability to
participate in or complete course work, let us know immediately -- **full
stop**.

Do not wait until the end of the semester.

Part of our role as course instructors is to make sure that students receive the
assistance they need.
Do not hesitate to let us know if there is anything we can do with respect to
your ability to handle your work.
This is especially true of our current circumstances of the on-going global
pandemic.
Again, let us remind and encourage you -- _**it is part of our job**_ to help
you access Allegheny College resources that will enable your safety and success.

In many situations, the following list of resources may prove useful:

* [The Maytum Center for Student Success](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentsuccess/)
